# HR Analytics Project in Power BI

## Introduction
Welcome to the HR Analytics Project, where we leverage the power of Power BI to transform raw HR data into insightful visualizations. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee attrition, compensation, work-life balance, and overall workforce demographics. By understanding these metrics, organizations can make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

## Data Cleaning and Visualization in Power BI
The data cleaning process is a crucial step to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis. In this project, raw HR data was meticulously cleaned using Power BI's robust data transformation tools. This included handling missing values, standardizing formats, and correcting inconsistencies.

After cleaning the data, various visualizations were created to represent the KPIs effectively. Power BI's interactive dashboards and reports allow for an in-depth exploration of the data, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights quickly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Average Attrition Rate for All Departments
This KPI measures the overall attrition rate across different departments. By analyzing attrition rates, we can identify departments with higher turnover and investigate potential causes to implement retention strategies.

### 2. Average Hourly Rate for Male Research Scientists
Understanding the compensation structure is vital for ensuring pay equity and competitiveness. This KPI focuses on the average hourly rate for male research scientists, providing insights into salary trends and benchmarks within the organization.

### 3. Attrition Rate vs Monthly Income Stats
This analysis examines the relationship between employee attrition rates and their monthly income. It helps to identify if income levels significantly influence the likelihood of employees leaving the company.

### 4. Average Working Years for Each Department
This KPI highlights the average number of years employees have worked in each department. It provides an overview of employee tenure, which can be indicative of departmental stability and employee satisfaction.

### 5. Job Role vs Work-Life Balance
Work-life balance is a critical factor in employee satisfaction and retention. This analysis compares different job roles to understand how work-life balance varies across the organization and identify areas for improvement.

### 6. Attrition Rate vs Years Since Last Promotion
This KPI explores the correlation between the attrition rate and the number of years since an employee's last promotion. It helps to identify if stagnation in career advancement contributes to higher turnover rates.

### 7. Average Age
This demographic KPI provides insights into the average age of employees within the organization. Understanding the age distribution can help in tailoring workforce management strategies to meet the needs of different age groups.

### 8. Average Years at Company
This KPI measures the average tenure of employees at the company. It provides an indication of employee loyalty and satisfaction, helping to assess the effectiveness of retention initiatives.

### 9. Total Employees
A fundamental metric, this KPI shows the total number of employees within the organization. It serves as a baseline for other analyses and helps to understand the scale of the workforce.

## Conclusion
The HR Analytics Project in Power BI offers a powerful toolset for visualizing and analyzing key HR metrics. By leveraging these insights, organizations can make informed decisions to enhance employee satisfaction, retention, and overall organizational performance. Feel free to explore the interactive dashboards and reports to gain a deeper understanding of the HR landscape within the organization.
