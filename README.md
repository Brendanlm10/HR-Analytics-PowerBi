# HR Analytics Dashboard Project Overview

## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard using Power BI to provide insights into various aspects of workforce management and human resources (HR) performance within the organization. The dashboard aimed to facilitate data-driven decision-making, optimize HR strategies, and enhance employee experience.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Gathering and Preparation:**
   - Identify and gather relevant HR data sources, including [employee turnover records](link), [recruitment metrics](link), [performance evaluations](link), [training data](link), [employee engagement surveys](link), [diversity metrics](link), and [HR cost data](link).
   - Cleanse and prepare the data by addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and data quality issues. Transform the data into a format suitable for analysis in Power BI.

2. **Dashboard Design and Layout:**
   - Define the key metrics and KPIs to be included in the dashboard, based on organizational goals, HR objectives, and stakeholder requirements.
   - Design the layout and structure of the dashboard, organizing the visuals and insights in a logical and intuitive manner for easy navigation and interpretation.
   - Select appropriate visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, KPI cards, and slicers, to effectively communicate HR metrics and trends.

3. **Data Modeling and Calculation:**
   - Create a data model in Power BI by importing the prepared HR data sources and establishing relationships between the tables.
   - Develop DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures and calculations to derive key HR metrics and KPIs, such as turnover rate, recruitment performance indicators, employee engagement scores, diversity metrics, and HR cost analysis.

4. **Visualizations and Insights:**
   - Build interactive visualizations and dashboards in Power BI to showcase the HR analytics insights and performance metrics.
   - Incorporate drill-down and filter capabilities to allow users to explore the data at various levels of detail and analyze trends, patterns, and outliers.
   - Provide annotations, commentary, and contextual information to help users interpret the data and derive actionable insights.

5. **User Testing and Feedback:**
   - Conduct user testing sessions with HR professionals, managers, and organizational leaders to gather feedback on the dashboard design, functionality, and usability.
   - Incorporate user feedback and iterate on the dashboard design and features to address usability issues, improve user experience, and ensure alignment with stakeholder needs.

6. **Deployment and Training:**
   - Deploy the finalized HR analytics dashboard to the intended audience, ensuring accessibility and availability through Power BI Service or other relevant platforms.
   - Provide training and support to users on how to navigate, interpret, and utilize the dashboard effectively for HR decision-making and strategic planning.

## Project Deliverables
The project deliverables include:
- The HR analytics dashboard in Power BI, showcasing key HR metrics and insights.
- Documentation outlining the dashboard design, data sources, calculations, and user guidance.
- Training materials and resources to support user adoption and proficiency in utilizing the dashboard for HR analytics and decision-making.

## Project Outcome
